                    <h3>Season</h3>
                    <p><i>The aurora borealis lights the sky over Lapland on up to 200 nights of the year, and on approximately one out of three nights in Rovaniemi. The best time to watch the northern lights is from September to late March. The best time to catch the Northern Lights is just before midnight, but this remains a matter of luck, and no reliable forecasts are possible to give.
                    <br>
                    In summer, the sky is too bright to experience the light. Aurora Borealis is to see on a clear night, although its appearance is unpredictable and it is never guaranteed to see it. Sometimes, the lights flare up for a brief moment only, at other times a fortunate watcher may enjoy the spectacle for several hours.</i></p>
